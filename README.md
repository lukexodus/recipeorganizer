# Recipe Organizer

## Features

### Nutrition Analysis

- API used: https://api.edamam.com/api/nutrition-details
  - Documentation: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api
- User inputs ingredients for a recipe and then the program analyzes the recipe and gives the nutrition data and other information about the recipe.
- The user is then given the option to store the recipe to recipe group or not.
- The analysis data received will contain categorization information for the recipe (labels and types).

### Recipe Categorization

- User can search stored recipes by categories (label and type).
- There are two types of labels: diet labels and health labels.
- There are three types of types: cuisine type, meal type, and dish type.

### Recipe Groups

- User can make, rename, and delete groups.
- User can move recipes to/from groups.
- User can select a recipe from the lists/groups.
- Every time a recipe is selected by the user, its nutrition facts, labels, and types are shown (just like in the nutrition analysis feature).
